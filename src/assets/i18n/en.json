	"about.description.1": "The lux foundation is a charitable initiative conceived by a committed group of music enthusiasts. It has two main aims: 1. To support entities engaged in charitable work. 2. To bring ancient music played in a historically authentic manner to a wider public. In order to achieve these aims the foundation has its own permanent ensemble of baroque instruments: Lux ensemble & Lux consort of viols",
	"about.description.2": "Wide experience and many years of study are an endorsement of the quality of the group. A feature of the ensemble is its flexibility in terms of the number of players for each project or concert. Our intention is to be able to offer a very wide repertoire which includes orchestral and chamber concerts or recitals by individual musicians. Our guiding principle is to create meticulously prepared events which are authentic in historic and musicological terms, using the instruments for which the pieces were originally created. In this way we aim to transport listeners to the magnificent Europe of the 17th and 18th centuries whilst also making a contribution to charity.",
	"about.description.3": "All profits from the Lux Foundation events go to bodies engaged in specific initiatives for those most in need. The aim is to act as a tool for any non-profit body to finance their work, whether this is the construction of a school, the provision of a medical service, or any other worthwhile initiative.",
	"about.description.4": "The Lux Foundation has its own label: LUX RECORDS. In 2014 came the 1st disc: \"Suonate en trio per diversi strumenti di JS Bach\", and 2015 came the 2nd: \"Rezos y Danzas. De batallas, xácaras, pasacalles y otros tientos\".",
